2.
documents/getCallCount.txt stores the design of the new system call
and the manual page. documents/changes.pdf stores the information of the
detailed changes that I made.

3.
test program is in test.c, I already changed the Makefile so once in xv6 shell,
run "test" to run the test program, the test program will ask for input, any string
