Code and documents in documents/part1/
debug1.c and debug2.c are the code for part1.1 and part1.2, and debug1 and debug2 are corresponding compiled files which can be directly executed or debugged.

when xv6 booted, run "test"

Design is in documents/part2/design.txt, which contains the information of the design and files we changed and the manual of the system call.

Test result is in documents/part2/test.txt, which contains pasted code and test result, and our explanation of why those are good test cases.
